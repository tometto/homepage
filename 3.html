  <h2>NFC</h2>
  <p><u>Near-field communication (NFC)</u> is <strong>a set of communication protocols</strong> for communication between two electronic devices over a distance of 4 cm (11‚ÅÑ2 in) or less. NFC offers a low-speed connection with simple setup that can be used to bootstrap more-capable wireless connections.</p>
  <p>NFC devices can act as electronic identity documents and keycards. They are used in contactless payment systems and allow mobile payment replacing or supplementing systems such as credit cards and electronic ticket smart cards. This is sometimes called NFC/CTLS or CTLS NFC, with contactless abbreviated CTLS. NFC can be used for sharing small files such as contacts, and bootstrapping fast connections to share larger media such as photos, videos, and other files.</p>
